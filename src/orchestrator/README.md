# Orchestrator

Orchestrator is the command authority of Sorinverse Platform.

It does not execute tasks.
It does not expose engines.
It does not allow direct workflow control.

Its only responsibility is:
- Accept intent
- Decide routing
- Return results

All execution is delegated.
All intelligence is abstracted.
All power is centralized.
