# Sorinverse Platform v1.0 · Platform Constitution

## 1. Platform Purpose

Sorinverse is an output-centric software platform designed to liberate human attention, hands, and cognitive load through AI-driven orchestration and automation.

The platform exists to:
- Reduce manual interaction
- Replace repetitive decision-making
- Enable voice-first, intent-based execution
- Deliver outcomes, not interfaces

Sorinverse is not an application.
It is a system container capable of hosting, composing, and executing applications as intent-driven outputs.

---

## 2. Core Principle: Output Over Interaction

Sorinverse operates under a strict principle:

> Users do not operate software.
> Software operates on behalf of users.

All systems must prioritize:
- Direct results
- Minimal UI interaction
- Automated execution
- Clear reporting of outcomes

Manual clicking is considered a fallback, not a primary mode.

---

## 3. Platform Layers

Sorinverse is composed of three strictly separated layers.

### 3.1 Architecture Layer (Core Engines)

The Architecture layer contains the fundamental engines that define reasoning, planning, coordination, and system intelligence.

Characteristics:
- Internal-only
- Mechanism is never disclosed
- Not sold, licensed, or bundled externally
- Acts as the cognitive and decision substrate of the platform

Any attempt to expose or commercialize internal engine logic is considered a violation of the platform constitution.

---

### 3.2 Pipeline Layer (Execution Runtime)

The Pipeline layer transforms intent into execution.

Responsibilities:
- Intent interpretation
- Planning
- Task execution
- Safety enforcement
- Result reporting

Pipelines operate automatically once authorized.
User confirmation is optional and context-dependent.

The Pipeline layer is also internal-only and never sold separately.

---

### 3.3 Systems Layer (Commercial Products)

The Systems layer contains all sellable products.

This includes:
- Apps (single-purpose systems)
- Modules (functional groupings)
- Packs (commercial bundles)

Only the Systems layer may be commercialized.

---

## 4. Product Definitions

### 4.1 App

An App is a self-contained functional unit that:
- Solves a specific problem
- Uses one or more internal engines
- Can be executed independently
- May expose a UI shell

Apps may be combined but are independently versioned.

---

### 4.2 Module

A Module is a curated collection of Apps designed around a shared purpose.

Modules:
- Contain no engine logic
- Only aggregate Apps
- Provide thematic or workflow coherence

Modules may be sold independently or included in Packs.

---

### 4.3 Pack

A Pack is a commercial delivery unit.

A Pack may include:
- Multiple Apps
- One or more Modules
- Predefined execution pipelines
- Voice-first presets

Packs are designed to be immediately usable without configuration.

---

## 5. Engine Secrecy & Non-Disclosure

All Architecture and Pipeline engines are:
- Proprietary
- Non-reproducible
- Non-exportable
- Mechanism-sealed

External parties may observe behavior but never inspect logic.

The platform guarantees functional access, not architectural transparency.

---

## 6. Voice-First Execution Principle

Voice is the primary command interface of Sorinverse.

Users may:
- Express intent verbally
- Approve or reject plans verbally
- Receive reports verbally

All systems must be designed to function without visual interaction.

---

## 7. Automation Authority

Once permissions are granted, Sorinverse may:
- Generate plans
- Execute actions
- Coordinate multiple systems
- Report results

The user is not required to micromanage execution.

---

## 8. User Data Sovereignty

All user data:
- Is stored locally
- Is not accessible to the platform owner
- Is not transmitted without explicit authorization

Local databases are considered user property.

---

## 9. Safety & Trust

Safety engines operate continuously.

If a system detects:
- Excessive risk
- Policy violation
- Unclear intent

Execution must pause or request clarification.

---

## 10. Constitutional Supremacy

This document is the highest authority of the Sorinverse Platform.

If any implementation, feature, or proposal conflicts with this constitution:
- The constitution prevails
- The implementation must be revised or removed

This constitution defines the identity and boundaries of Sorinverse.
